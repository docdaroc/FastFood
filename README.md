# FastFood
Simple console app - my first attempt for uploading code to Git Hub repository using Git Bash.
<<<<<<< HEAD
The app is simulation on simple situation using the main principles of OOP - placing an order in a fast food restaurant e.g. user is able to order single item (burger, drink or a side item), or a meal (containing burger, drink and side item). Basic meal contains basic burger e.g. Hamburger with small drink and a small side item or a better meal containing higher class burgers with availability on the size. Up to three toppings can be added with free of choice drink and side item per size. 
For now there isn't any an exact list of available burgers, drinks and side items, and menus but will be added soon.
Exceptions not handled - will be added soon (I've just tryed the GitHubAndIlikeIt).

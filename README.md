# FastFood
Simple console app - my first attempt for uploading code to Git Hub repository using Git Bash.
The app is simulation on simple situation - placing an order in a fast food restaurant e.g. user is able to order single item (burger, drink or a side item),
or a meal (containing burger, drink and side item). Basic meal contains basic burger e.g. Hamburger with small drink and a small side item - kind of them are not listed,
or a better meal containing higher class burgers. Up to three toppings can be added with free of choice drink and side item per size. 
For now there isn't any list of available drinks and side items, but will be added soon.
Exceptions not handled - will be added soon.
